# ATTENTION: GloSC is currently being rewritten, and renamed to GlosSI ([Glo]bal ([s]ystemwide) [S]team [I]nput)

No ETA when it's done  
No support until then.  

**Looking for contributors!**  
As the past has shown, I have way to less time on hand too maintain such a project.  
Reach out via Discord/E-Mail (But get to the point right away, please, I get way too much spam)  

See: [BUILDING](./BUILDING.md) / [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/Alia5/GlosSI/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

# GlosSI

GlosSI or [Glo]bal ([s]ystemwide) [S]team [I]nput, formerly knows as GloSC (Global Steam Controller), is a tool that allows one to use Steam-Input controller rebinding at a system-level alongside a system wide (borderless window) Steam overlay  
All complete with **per application bindings and working rumble emulation.**  
GlosSI can, but isn't required to, launch any of your favorite games or applications and directly add them to Steam, be it Win32 or Windows Store (UWP)!  
It is **the tool** to enjoy any game that has trouble with Steam and/or *add extra functionality* to your Steam-Input needs  

*Windows Store*, *Reshade / SweetFX*, *Origin*, *Uplay*, *Emulators* and *more* with **no hassle**â„¢

GlosSI provides its [own overlay](./Overlay.md), in addition to that of Steam.
