# Contributing

Feel free to take on any feature-request, bug report or whatever idea you have.  
If you feel like it, you can also look at the many TODOs sprinkled throughout the code.

## Building / Dev environment

For building instructions see [BUILDING.md](./BUILDING.md)

If you need technical assistance, reach out via e-mail or any other channel you might find.  
Please get to the chase right away, though, as I get way to much spam.  
Please also note, that I'm short on time and might not reply immediately  
Also I'm least available on Discord.

## Pull Requests

Please keep your feature branch up to date with the latest changes from the `develop` branch.  

Use [git-rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase); If your feature branch contains backmerges it will be ignored.
